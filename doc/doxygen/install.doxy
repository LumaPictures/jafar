/*! \page pageInstall Installing Jafar

\section secInstallGettingSource Getting the source

\subsection subsecInstallLonelyInstall Lonely installation

Untar the Jafar archive in a directory of your choice, that's all ! If needed add the desired modules in the \c jafar/modules/ directory.

\subsection subsecInstallVersionedInstall Versioned installation

It is likely that several developpers work on inter-dependent Jafar
modules at the same time. In this case each developper will checkout
its own copy. LAAS users must read \ref subsecLaasCo.

\section secInstallDependencies Jafar dependencies

Jafar uses \e swig to generate module's tcl interface, you must have this tool installed. Some modules use advanced swig features (and bugfix) which only appeared in swig 1.3.25.

Each jafar module can have its own dependencies, the dependencies appears in the \c User.make of each module. The most often used libraries in Jafar are \e boost and \e openCV.

\section secInstallEnvironment Setting your environment

    - Set your environement variable \c $JAFAR_DIR  to the directory where you uncompress or checkout the jafar source.
    - If necessary add to your \c $LD_LIBRARY_PATH \c $JAFAR_DIR/lib/platform.

Then you can start to \e configure jafar and \e compile the modules.

\section secInstallConfigureMake ./configure, make

\subsection subsecInstallConfigure ./configure

The only configure script of jafar is located in the \c jafar/ directory. It will generate \c Module.config from \c Module.config.in, and \c include/jafarConfig.h from \c include/jafarConfig.h.in: 
    - \c Module.config defines platform specific tools and options,
    - \c jafarConfig.h defines preprocessor variables to be used by developper for conditionnal compilation based on the current configuration (\c HAVE_LAPACK, \c HAVE_OPENGL, ...)

This is a standard configure script, to get help on the available options:

\verbatim
$ ./configure --help
\endverbatim

\subsection subsecInstallMake make

The compilation process of each module is driven by four Makefiles. Two of them are global to all modules, they are in the \c jafar/ directory:
    - \c Module.rules defines compilation rules,
    - \c Module.config defines platform specific tools and options (through configure process).

The two others are in each module directory:
    - \c Makefile is the entry point of the \e make command, it \e must not be modified,
    - \c User.make contains all specific options related to that module (\ref secModuleUserMake).

\section secInstallTclsh Tcl shell configuration

In order to use jafar from a tcl shell, you need to source \c $JAFAR_DIR/share/initJafar.tcl to set up some variables. It is handy
to add the \c source command into your .tclshrc file for example.

We also recommend you use a completion system within your shell:

  - eltclsh: http://softs.laas.fr/openrobots/tools/eltclsh.php
  - tclreadline: http://tclreadline.sourceforge.net

For using with tclreadline, the file \c $JAFAR_DIR/share/tclreadlineJafar.tcl setups the tclreadline package for jafar.

Also, <a href="http://incrtcl.sourceforge.net">[incr tcl]</a> object oriented extention to tcl can be very usefull. 

A typical \c .tclshrc looks like:
\verbatim
package require Itcl
namespace import ::itcl::*

source $env(JAFAR_DIR)/share/initJafar.tcl

kernel::addHashedDirectory "/home/thomas/myJafarMacros/"
kernel::rehash

source $env(JAFAR_DIR)/share/tclreadlineJafar.tcl
\endverbatim
